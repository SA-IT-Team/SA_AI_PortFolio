You are a senior frontend engineer. Build a production-ready portfolio website for “SA Tech Private India Ltd” showcasing our AI products, agents, and AI-integrated solutions.
 
TECH STACK (must follow)
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (preferred) or CRA (only if needed). Use Vite by default.
- Tailwind CSS (properly configured)
- lucide-react icons
- React Router for navigation (if multi-page). If you choose single-page with sections, still implement hash navigation + smooth scroll.
- Clean, scalable folder structure, reusable components, and strongly typed data model.
 
THEME / BRAND (strict)
- Primary background: white (#FFFFFF)
- Primary accent: light blue (use a modern palette around #3B82F6 / #60A5FA but keep it LIGHT)
- Secondary accents: very light blue backgrounds (e.g., #EFF6FF / #DBEAFE)
- Text: slate/neutral (e.g., #0F172A / #334155)
- Overall look: minimal, premium, enterprise SaaS.
- Avoid dark themes. Keep 90%+ white/light surfaces.
